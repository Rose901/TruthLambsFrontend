                <h5>Worry</h5>
                <p>Worry might start as just something small that’s on our mind, but it can very easily begin to grab more
                    of us until it is consuming so much of our time and energy. Sometimes it is big things we are worrying
                    about but others times it is something we know is small but we just can’t shake it out of our mind. –
                    many people struggle with this, men, women, young, old, married, unmarried, those who believe in a God
                    and those who don’t. It would be great to chat with you about things that will help you to feel more
                    full of hope and purpose, and to pray for you if that is something you would like. We are all more than
                    just a physical body, we also have feelings, emotions and a spiritual side to us. We really need to think
                    about how to help the whole of us and not just our physical bodies. Here are some suggestions people
                    have found helpful…</p>
                <hr>

                <h5>Why do you worry? </h5>
                <p>
                    It is good to think about why we do it and why we want to stop doing it. Often we worry because we feel that everything is
                    out of our control and we don’t trust that the outcome is going to be okay. But for some people there
                    may be another reason that causes them to worry – maybe a bad past experience which you feel is going
                    to become the pattern for how things will go in the future. Also we need to be clear about why we want
                    to stop – what is motivating you to want to not worry? Some people find worrying something they would
                    prefer to cling on to rather than let go of – if that’s how you feel then again it’s good to ask ourselves
                    why we feel like that, are we getting some kind of security from our worry? Motivation is important in
                    breaking free from any thing that has a hold on us – why do you want to be free from worry, is it making
                    you unwell? Preventing you from sleeping? Stopping you making decisions? Is it getting in the way of
                    you having a friendship with God?</p>
                <hr>
                <h5>How? Where? When?</h5>
                Do you always worry about everything and anything? Or is it normally focused around something in particular? Are there certain
                times of day when you worry? or particular days or times of the year? Do you only worry when you are alone?
                or in the middle of the night? or is worry always with you even when you are busy with other people?
                <hr>
                <h5>Let someone else be in charge</h5>
                When we feel that our happiness depend upon us being able to make certain things happen or not happen, then we can have peace
                while we have control over them, but when we lose control we feel like things are not how they should be,
                and we worry about what will happen next or where this uncontrollable situation will end up. We can’t ever
                control every outcome to make it just right, instead we need to let go and allow someone else to be in charge,
                let someone else take responsibility. Some people find it helpful to pass this responsibility over to their
                husband or wife, or their mother or father and this can be helpful, but we must remember that they are only
                human and so will make mistakes some of the time and you would have to accept that. It is far better instead
                to put your trust in Jesus – he promises that if we follow him then he will make sure that everything works
                together for our good. That kind of promise can bring you such peace and hope, even in the darkest storm.
