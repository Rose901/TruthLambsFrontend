    <h3> Q. Are there Second Chances After Death?</h3>
    <strong>answer</strong>
      <p>This question often comes our way in various forms, but the essence of the matter is this: Are there second chances after death to correct failures we made in life?
        
        The short answer is “No!”
        
        27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment (Hebrews 9:27).
        
        8 Then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming; 9 that is, the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders, 10 and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved. 11 For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false, 12 in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness. 13 But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth. 14 It was for this He called you through our gospel, that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Thessalonians 2:8-14, emphasis mine).
